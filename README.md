### Inventory Management

Managing stock inventory is a fundamental operation that allows businesses to track and manage their products efficiently. This repository provides examples of how to add, update, and remove inventory items, as well as how to generate reports on stock levels.

## Demonstration

Here is a demonstration of the `addInventoryItem` function from the `InventoryManager.kt` file:

```kotlin
// filepath: /home/guan/Documents/Code/Stock-Inventory-Control/src/main/kotlin/com/example/inventory/InventoryManager.kt
fun addInventoryItem(item: InventoryItem) {
    // ...existing code...
    inventoryList.add(item)
    println("Item added: ${item.name}")
    // ...existing code...
}
```

This function adds a new item to the inventory list and prints a confirmation message.
